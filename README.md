# Containerize MkDocs
This Project is for the Docker image which wraps MkDocs. It produces functions as follows.

## Build the image
You can build the Docker image from this project like this:
```
cd <your-local-empty-dir>
git clone <this-project> .
docker build -t <the-docker-image-name> . 
```

## Use the image
## Producing the website
The `produce` command writes your local MkDocs documentation to the stdout a .tar.gz file which packed web assets generated by mkdocs.

At first, you have to prepare a valid MkDocs documentation in your local file system beforehand.
Then you can execute the `produce` command with a local directory of your MkDocs documentation :
```sh
$ docker run -v <local-path-to-mkdocs-dir>:/mkdocs <the-docker-image-name> produce
```

For the next "Serving the website" step, you should write out the stdout to a .tar.gz file:
```sh
$ docker run -v <local-path-to-mkdocs-dir>:/mkdocs <the-docker-image-name> produce > output.tar.gz
```

## Serving the website
Note that you must execute the `produce` command and write out the stdout to a .tar.gz file beforehand.
The `serve` command reads the .tar.gz file from stdin and serves it. For example:
```sh
$ cat <output-from-produce>.tar.gz | docker run -i -p 8000:8000 serve
```
Then you can access `http://localhost:8000/`.
